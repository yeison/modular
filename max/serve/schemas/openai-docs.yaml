  title: MAX REST API reference
  description: |

    MAX is a high-performance, Python-based inference server for
    deploying large language models (LLMs) locally or in the cloud. It provides
    efficient request handling through advanced batching and scheduling, and
    an OpenAI-compatible REST endpoint.

    ## Get started

    With just a few commands, you can start a local endpoint with the GenAI
    model of your choice using our [`max`](/max/max-cli) CLI
    and start sending requests.

    When you want to deploy your model to a cloud-hosted endpoint, you can use
    our [MAX container](/max/container)—see our [Get started with
    MAX](/max/get-started) and then see our tutorials on using MAX:

    - [Start a chat endpoint](/max/tutorials/start-a-chat-endpoint)
    - [Serve an embedding model with MAX](/max/tutorials/run-embeddings-with-max-serve)
    - [Generate image descriptions with Llama 3.2 Vision](/max/tutorials/deploy-llama-vision)
    - [Deploy Llama 3 on GPU-powered Kubernetes clusters](/max/tutorials/max-serve-local-to-cloud)

    ## OpenAI API compatibility

    The MAX REST API is compatible with a subset of the [OpenAI REST
    API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction). This
    allows you to use many existing OpenAI client applications with MAX
    endpoints.

    - **Supported endpoints:**

        - [Chat completions](#operation/createChatCompletion) (`/v1/chat/completions`)
        - [Completions](#operation/createCompletion) (`/v1/completions`)
        - [Embeddings](#operation/createEmbedding) (`/v1/embeddings`)
        - [Batches](#operation/createBatch) (`/v1/batches`) - The `v1/batches` API is only available to users in the [Mammoth](/mammoth/) public preview.
        - [List models](#operation/listModels) (`/v1/models`)
        - [Health check](#operation/health) (`/health`)

    - **Parameter handling:** While aiming for high compatibility, not all
    OpenAI body parameters are implemented. Some may be accepted as no-ops
    (ignored but won't cause errors) to maintain client compatibility. The
    specific endpoint documentation below details only the parameters that
    actively affect behavior in MAX.

    In addition to the OpenAI APIs, MAX provides a Prometheus-formatted
    [metrics endpoint](/max/container#metrics) to help track your model's
    performance.

        Creates a completion for the chat message. MAX supports a subset of
        OpenAI's chat completion parameters.
        Streaming is supported, but
        [chat-object](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat-streaming/streaming)
        and
        [chat-streaming](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat-streaming)
        response formats have limitations.
