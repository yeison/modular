    This converts images into patch embeddings and adds position embeddings.
    Unlike the PyTorch version, we simplify position ID generation since it's
    always just a sequential range from 0 to num_patches-1.

    The modifications are adapted from [Patch n' Pack: NaViT, a Vision Transformer
    for any Aspect Ratio and Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06304) which
    allows treating images in their native aspect ratio and without the need to
    resize them to the same fixed size.
