    rotmg_strided_batched creates the modified Givens rotation matrix for the strided batched vectors (d1_i * x1_i, d2_i * y1_i), for i = 1, ..., batch_count.
          Parameters may be stored in either host or device memory. Location is specified by calling rocblas_set_pointer_mode:

    - If the pointer mode is set to rocblas_pointer_mode_host, then this function blocks the CPU until the GPU has finished and the results are available in host memory.
    - If the pointer mode is set to rocblas_pointer_mode_device, then this function returns immediately and synchronization is required to read the results.

    @param[in]
    handle  [rocblas_handle]
            handle to the rocblas library context queue.
    @param[in, out]
    d1      device strided_batched array or host strided_batched array of input scalars that is overwritten.
    @param[in]
    stride_d1 [rocblas_stride]

    @param[in, out]
    d2      device strided_batched array or host strided_batched array of input scalars that is overwritten.
    @param[in]
    stride_d2 [rocblas_stride]
              specifies the increment between the beginning of d2_i and d2_(i+1).
    @param[in, out]
    x1      device strided_batched array or host strided_batched array of input scalars that is overwritten.
    @param[in]
    stride_x1 [rocblas_stride]
              specifies the increment between the beginning of x1_i and x1_(i+1).
    @param[in]
    y1      device strided_batched array or host strided_batched array of input scalars.
    @param[in]
    stride_y1 [rocblas_stride]
              specifies the increment between the beginning of y1_i and y1_(i+1).
    @param[out]
    param   device strided_batched array or host strided_batched array of vectors of 5 elements defining the rotation.

        param[0] = flag
        param[1] = H11
        param[2] = H21
        param[3] = H12
        param[4] = H22
        The flag parameter defines the form of H:

        flag = -1 => H = ( H11 H12 H21 H22 )
        flag =  0 => H = ( 1.0 H12 H21 1.0 )

        param may be stored in either host or device memory.
        Location is specified by calling rocblas_set_pointer_mode.

    @param[in]
    stride_param [rocblas_stride]
                 specifies the increment between the beginning of param_i and param_(i + 1).
    @param[in]

    trsm solves:

        op(A)*X = alpha*B or  X*op(A) = alpha*B,

        where alpha is a scalar, X and B are m by n matrices,

        A is triangular matrix and op(A) is one of

        op( A ) = A   or   op( A ) = A^T   or   op( A ) = A^H.

        The matrix X is overwritten on B.

    Note about memory allocation:
    When trsm is launched with a k evenly divisible by the internal block size of 128,
    and is no larger than 10 of these blocks, the API takes advantage of utilizing pre-allocated
    memory found in the handle to increase overall performance. This memory can be managed by using
    the environment variable WORKBUF_TRSM_B_CHNK. When this variable is not set the device memory
    used for temporary storage will default to 1 MB and may result in chunking, which in turn may
    reduce performance. Under these circumstances it is recommended that WORKBUF_TRSM_B_CHNK be set
    to the desired chunk of right hand sides to be used at a time
    (where k is m when rocblas_side_left and is n when rocblas_side_right).

    Although not widespread, some gemm kernels used by trsm may use atomic operations.
    See Atomic Operations in the API Reference Guide for more information.

    rotmg_batched creates the modified Givens rotation matrix for the batched vectors (d1_i * x1_i, d2_i * y1_i), for i = 1, ..., batch_count.
          Parameters may be stored in either host or device memory. Location is specified by calling rocblas_set_pointer_mode:

    - If the pointer mode is set to rocblas_pointer_mode_host, then this function blocks the CPU until the GPU has finished and the results are available in host memory.
    - If the pointer mode is set to rocblas_pointer_mode_device, then this function returns immediately and synchronization is required to read the results.

    \\brief <b> BLAS Level 1 API </b>.

    \\details
    rotm_batched applies the modified Givens rotation matrix defined by param_i to batched vectors x_i and y_i, for i = 1, ..., batch_count.

    @param[in]
    handle  [rocblas_handle]
            handle to the rocblas library context queue.
    @param[in]
    n       [rocblas_int]
            number of elements in the x and y vectors.
    @param[in, out]
    x       device array of device pointers storing each vector x_i.
    @param[in]
    incx    [rocblas_int]
            specifies the increment between elements of each x_i.
    @param[in, out]
    y       device array of device pointers storing each vector y_1.
    @param[in]
    incy    [rocblas_int]
            specifies the increment between elements of each y_i.
    @param[in]
    param   device array of device vectors of 5 elements defining the rotation.

        param[0] = flag
        param[1] = H11
        param[2] = H21
        param[3] = H12
        param[4] = H22

        The flag parameter defines the form of H:

        flag = -1 => H = ( H11 H12 H21 H22 )
        flag =  0 => H = ( 1.0 H12 H21 1.0 )
        flag =  1 => H = ( H11 1.0 -1.0 H22 )
        flag = -2 => H = ( 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 )

        param may ONLY be stored on the device for the batched version of this function.

    @param[in]
    batch_count [rocblas_int]
                the number of x and y arrays, i.e. the number of batches.

    \\details
    gemm_strided_batched_ex performs one of the strided_batched matrix-matrix operations:

        D_i = alpha*op(A_i)*op(B_i) + beta*C_i, for i = 1, ..., batch_count

    where op( X ) is one of

        op( X ) = X      or
        op( X ) = X**T   or
        op( X ) = X**H,

    alpha and beta are scalars, and A, B, C, and D are strided_batched matrices, with
    op( A ) an m by k by batch_count strided_batched matrix,
    op( B ) a k by n by batch_count strided_batched matrix and
    C and D are m by n by batch_count strided_batched matrices.
    C and D may point to the same matrices if their parameters are identical.

    The strided_batched matrices are multiple matrices separated by a constant stride.
    The number of matrices is batch_count.

    Supported types are as follows:
        - rocblas_datatype_f64_r = a_type = b_type = c_type = d_type = compute_type
        - rocblas_datatype_f32_r = a_type = b_type = c_type = d_type = compute_type
        - rocblas_datatype_f16_r = a_type = b_type = c_type = d_type = compute_type

        where (A_i, x_i, y_i) is the i-th instance of the batch.
        alpha and beta are scalars, x_i and y_i are vectors and A_i is an
        m by n matrix, for i = 1, ..., batch_count.

    @param[in]
    handle      [rocblas_handle]
                handle to the rocblas library context queue.
    @param[in]
    transA      [rocblas_operation]
                indicates whether matrices A_i are transposed (conjugated) or not.
    @param[in]

                number of rows of matrices A_i.
    @param[in]

                number of columns of matrices A_i.
    @param[in]
    alpha       device pointer or host pointer to scalar alpha.
    @param[in]
    A           device pointer to the first matrix (A_1) in the batch.
    @param[in]
    lda         [rocblas_int]
                specifies the leading dimension of matrices A_i.
    @param[in]
    strideA     [rocblas_stride]
                stride from the start of one matrix (A_i) and the next one (A_i+1).

    x           device pointer to the first vector (x_1) in the batch.
    @param[in]
    incx        [rocblas_int]
                specifies the increment for the elements of vectors x_i.

    stridex     [rocblas_stride]
                stride from the start of one vector (x_i) and the next one (x_i+1).
                There are no restrictions placed on stride_x. However, ensure that stride_x is of appropriate size. When trans equals rocblas_operation_none
                this typically means stride_x >= n * incx, otherwise stride_x >= m * incx.

    \\brief <b> BLAS Level 3 API </b>.

    \\details
    trmm_batched performs one of the matrix-matrix operations:

        C_i := alpha*op( A_i )*B_i,   or
        C_i := alpha*B_i*op( A_i )  for i = 0, 1, ... batch_count -1,

    The Legacy BLAS in-place trmm_batched functionality,

        B_i := alpha*op( A_i )*B_i,   or
        B_i := alpha*B_i*op( A_i )  for i = 0, 1, ... batch_count -1,

    is available by setting pointer C equal to pointer B and ldc equal to ldb.

        alpha  is a scalar,  B_i  is an m by n matrix, C_i  is an m by n matrix,  A_i  is a unit, or
        non-unit,  upper or lower triangular matrix  and  op( A_i )  is one  of

        op( A_i ) = A_i     or
        op( A_i ) = A_i^T   or
        op( A_i ) = A_i^H.

        When uplo == rocblas_fill_upper the  leading  k by k
        upper triangular part of the array  A must contain the upper
        triangular matrix and the strictly lower triangular part of
        A is not referenced. Here k is m when side == rocblas_side_left
        and is n when side == rocblas_side_right.

        When uplo == rocblas_fill_lower the  leading  k by k
        lower triangular part of the array  A must contain the lower
        triangular matrix  and the strictly upper triangular part of
        A is not referenced. Here k is m when  side == rocblas_side_left
        and is n when side == rocblas_side_right.

        Note that when  diag == rocblas_diagonal_unit  the diagonal elements of
        A  are not referenced either,  but are assumed to be  unity.

    @param[in]
    handle    [rocblas_handle]
              handle to the rocblas library context queue.

    @param[in]
    side    [rocblas_side]
            Specifies whether op(A_i) multiplies B_i from the left or right as follows:
            - rocblas_side_left:       C_i := alpha*op( A_i )*B_i
            - rocblas_side_right:      C_i := alpha*B_i*op( A_i )

    @param[in]
    uplo    [rocblas_fill]
            Specifies whether the matrix A is an upper or lower triangular matrix as follows:
            - rocblas_fill_upper:  A is an upper triangular matrix.
            - rocblas_fill_lower:  A is a  lower triangular matrix.

    @param[in]
    transA  [rocblas_operation]
            Specifies the form of op(A_i) to be used in the matrix multiplication as follows:
            - rocblas_operation_none:    op(A_i) = A_i
            - rocblas_operation_transpose:      op(A_i) = A_i^T
            - rocblas_operation_conjugate_transpose:  op(A_i) = A_i^H

    @param[in]
    diag    [rocblas_diagonal]
            Specifies whether or not A_i is unit triangular as follows:
            - rocblas_diagonal_unit:      A_i is assumed to be unit triangular.
            - rocblas_diagonal_non_unit:  A_i is not assumed to be unit triangular.

    @param[in]
    m       [rocblas_int]
            m specifies the number of rows of B_i. m >= 0.

    @param[in]
    n       [rocblas_int]
            n specifies the number of columns of B_i. n >= 0.

    @param[in]
    alpha
            alpha specifies the scalar alpha. When alpha is
            zero then A_i is not referenced and B_i need not be set before
            entry.

    @param[in]
    A       Device array of device pointers storing each matrix A_i on the GPU.
            Each A_i is of dimension ( lda, k ), where k is m
            when  side == rocblas_side_left  and
            is  n  when  side == rocblas_side_right.

            When uplo == rocblas_fill_upper the  leading  k by k
            upper triangular part of the array  A must contain the upper
            triangular matrix  and the strictly lower triangular part of
            A is not referenced.

            When uplo == rocblas_fill_lower the  leading  k by k
            lower triangular part of the array  A must contain the lower
            triangular matrix  and the strictly upper triangular part of
            A is not referenced.

        Note that when  diag == rocblas_diagonal_unit  the diagonal elements of
        A_i  are not referenced either,  but are assumed to be  unity.

    @param[in]
    lda     [rocblas_int]
            lda specifies the first dimension of A.

                if side == rocblas_side_left,  lda >= max( 1, m ),
                if side == rocblas_side_right, lda >= max( 1, n ).

    @param[in]
    B       device array of device pointers storing each matrix B_i on the GPU.

    @param[in]
    ldb    [rocblas_int]
           ldb specifies the first dimension of B_i. ldb >= max( 1, m ).

    @param[out]
    C      device array of device pointers storing each matrix C_i on the GPU.

    @param[in]
    ldc   [rocblas_int]
          ldc specifies the first dimension of C. ldc >= max( 1, m).
          If B and C are pointers to the same array of pointers then ldc must
          equal ldb or rocblas_status_invalid_value will be returned.

    @param[in]
    batch_count [rocblas_int]
                number of instances i in the batch.

    trsm_batched performs the following batched operation:

        op(A_i)*X_i = alpha*B_i or
        X_i*op(A_i) = alpha*B_i, for i = 1, ..., batch_count,

        where alpha is a scalar, X and B are batched m by n matrices,

        A is triangular batched matrix and op(A) is one of

        op( A ) = A   or
        op( A ) = A^T   or
        op( A ) = A^H.

        Each matrix X_i is overwritten on B_i for i = 1, ..., batch_count.

    Note about memory allocation:
    When trsm is launched with a k evenly divisible by the internal block size of 128,
    and is no larger than 10 of these blocks, the API takes advantage of utilizing pre-allocated
    memory found in the handle to increase overall performance. This memory can be managed by using
    the environment variable WORKBUF_TRSM_B_CHNK. When this variable is not set the device memory
    used for temporary storage will default to 1 MB and may result in chunking, which in turn may
    reduce performance. Under these circumstances it is recommended that WORKBUF_TRSM_B_CHNK be set
    to the desired chunk of right hand sides to be used at a time
    (where k is m when rocblas_side_left and is n when rocblas_side_right).

        where  alpha and beta are scalars, op(A) and op(B) are n by k matrices, and
        C is a n x n Hermitian matrix stored as either upper or lower.

        op( A ) = A, op( B ) = B, and A and B are n by k if trans == rocblas_operation_none
        op( A ) = A^H, op( B ) = B^H,  and A and B are k by n if trans == rocblas_operation_conjugate_transpose

    @param[in]
    handle    [rocblas_handle]
              handle to the rocblas library context queue.

    @param[in]
    n       [rocblas_int]
            n specifies the number of rows and columns of C. n >= 0.

    @param[in]
    k       [rocblas_int]
            k specifies the number of columns of op(A). k >= 0.

    @param[in]
    alpha
            alpha specifies the scalar alpha. When alpha is
            zero then A is not referenced and A need not be set before
            entry.

    @param[in]
    A       pointer storing matrix A on the GPU.
            Matrix dimension is ( lda, k ) when if trans = rocblas_operation_none, otherwise (lda, n)

    @param[in]
    lda     [rocblas_int]
            lda specifies the first dimension of A.

                if trans = rocblas_operation_none,  lda >= max( 1, n ),
                otherwise lda >= max( 1, k ).

            beta specifies the scalar beta. When beta is
            zero then C need not be set before entry.

    @param[in]
    C       pointer storing matrix C on the GPU.
            The imaginary component of the diagonal elements are not used but are set to zero unless quick return.
            only the upper/lower triangular part is accessed.

    @param[in]
    ldc    [rocblas_int]
           ldc specifies the first dimension of C. ldc >= max( 1, n ).

    \\brief <b> BLAS Level 3 API </b>.

    \\details
    her2k_batched performs a batch of the matrix-matrix operations for a Hermitian rank-2k update:

        C_i := alpha*op( A_i )*op( B_i )^H + conj(alpha)*op( B_i )*op( A_i )^H + beta*C_i,

        where  alpha and beta are scalars, op(A_i) and op(B_i) are n by k matrices, and
        C_i is a n x n Hermitian matrix stored as either upper or lower.

        op( A_i ) = A_i, op( B_i ) = B_i, and A_i and B_i are n by k if trans == rocblas_operation_none
        op( A_i ) = A_i^H, op( B_i ) = B_i^H,  and A_i and B_i are k by n if trans == rocblas_operation_conjugate_transpose

    @param[in]
    handle    [rocblas_handle]
              handle to the rocblas library context queue.

    @param[in]
    uplo    [rocblas_fill]
            - rocblas_fill_upper:  C_i is an upper triangular matrix
            - rocblas_fill_lower:  C_i is a  lower triangular matrix

    @param[in]
    trans  [rocblas_operation]
            - rocblas_operation_conjugate_transpose: op(A) = A^H
            - rocblas_operation_none:                op(A) = A

    @param[in]
    n       [rocblas_int]
            n specifies the number of rows and columns of C_i. n >= 0.

    @param[in]
    k       [rocblas_int]
            k specifies the number of columns of op(A). k >= 0.

    @param[in]
    alpha
            alpha specifies the scalar alpha. When alpha is
            zero then A is not referenced and A need not be set before
            entry.

    @param[in]
    A       device array of device pointers storing each matrix_i A of dimension (lda, k)
            when trans is rocblas_operation_none, otherwise of dimension (lda, n).

    @param[in]
    lda     [rocblas_int]
            lda specifies the first dimension of A_i.

                if trans = rocblas_operation_none,  lda >= max( 1, n ),
                otherwise lda >= max( 1, k ).
    @param[in]
    B       device array of device pointers storing each matrix_i B of dimension (ldb, k)
            when trans is rocblas_operation_none, otherwise of dimension (ldb, n).

    @param[in]
    ldb     [rocblas_int]
            ldb specifies the first dimension of B_i.

                if trans = rocblas_operation_none,  ldb >= max( 1, n ),
                otherwise ldb >= max( 1, k ).
    @param[in]
    beta
            beta specifies the scalar beta. When beta is
            zero then C need not be set before entry.

    @param[in]
    C       device array of device pointers storing each matrix C_i on the GPU.
            The imaginary component of the diagonal elements are not used but are set to zero unless quick return.
            only the upper/lower triangular part of each C_i is accessed.

    @param[in]
    ldc    [rocblas_int]
           ldc specifies the first dimension of C. ldc >= max( 1, n ).
    @param[in]
    batch_count [rocblas_int]
                number of instances in the batch.

    \\brief <b> BLAS Level 2 API </b>.

    \\details
    gbmv performs one of the matrix-vector operations:

        y := alpha*A*x    + beta*y,   or
        y := alpha*A**T*x + beta*y,   or
        y := alpha*A**H*x + beta*y,
        where alpha and beta are scalars, x and y are vectors and A is an
        m by n banded matrix with kl sub-diagonals and ku super-diagonals.

    @param[in]
    handle    [rocblas_handle]
              handle to the rocblas library context queue.
    @param[in]
    trans     [rocblas_operation]
              indicates whether matrix A is transposed (conjugated) or not.
    @param[in]
    m         [rocblas_int]
              number of rows of matrix A.
    @param[in]
    n         [rocblas_int]
              number of columns of matrix A.
    @param[in]
    kl        [rocblas_int]
              number of sub-diagonals of A.
    @param[in]
    ku        [rocblas_int]
              number of super-diagonals of A.
    @param[in]
    alpha     device pointer or host pointer to scalar alpha.
    @param[in]
        A     device pointer storing banded matrix A.
              Leading (kl + ku + 1) by n part of the matrix contains the coefficients
              of the banded matrix. The leading diagonal resides in row (ku + 1) with
              the first super-diagonal above on the RHS of row ku. The first sub-diagonal
              resides below on the LHS of row ku + 2. This propagates up and down across
              sub/super-diagonals.

                    Ex: (m = n = 7; ku = 2, kl = 2)

              Note that the empty elements which do not correspond to data will not
              be referenced.
    @param[in]
    lda       [rocblas_int]
              specifies the leading dimension of A. Must be >= (kl + ku + 1).
    @param[in]
    x         device pointer storing vector x.
    @param[in]
    incx      [rocblas_int]
              specifies the increment for the elements of x.
    @param[in]
    beta      device pointer or host pointer to scalar beta.
    @param[in, out]
    y         device pointer storing vector y.
    @param[in]
    incy      [rocblas_int]
              specifies the increment for the elements of y.

    trmm performs one of the matrix-matrix operations:

        C := alpha*op( A )*B,   or
        C := alpha*B*op( A ),

    The Legacy BLAS in-place trmm functionality,

        B := alpha*op( A )*B,   or
        B := alpha*B*op( A ),

    is available by setting pointer C equal to pointer B, and ldc equal to ldb.

        alpha  is a scalar,  B  is an m by n matrix, C  is an m by n matrix,  A  is a unit, or
        non-unit,  upper or lower triangular matrix  and  op( A )  is one  of

        op( A ) = A     or
        op( A ) = A^T   or
        op( A ) = A^H.

        When uplo == rocblas_fill_upper the  leading  k by k
        upper triangular part of the array  A must contain the upper
        triangular matrix and the strictly lower triangular part of
        A is not referenced. Here k is m when side == rocblas_side_left
        and is n when side == rocblas_side_right.

        When uplo == rocblas_fill_lower the  leading  k by k
        lower triangular part of the array  A must contain the lower
        triangular matrix  and the strictly upper triangular part of
        A is not referenced. Here k is m when  side == rocblas_side_left
        and is n when side == rocblas_side_right.

        Note that when  diag == rocblas_diagonal_unit  the diagonal elements of
        A  are not referenced either,  but are assumed to be  unity.

              handle to the rocblas library context queue.

    @param[in]
    side    [rocblas_side]
            Specifies whether op(A) multiplies B from the left or right as follows:

            Specifies whether the matrix A is an upper or lower triangular matrix as follows:
            - rocblas_fill_upper:  A is an upper triangular matrix.
            - rocblas_fill_lower:  A is a  lower triangular matrix.

    @param[in]
    transA  [rocblas_operation]

    @param[in]
    diag    [rocblas_diagonal]
            Specifies whether or not A is unit triangular as follows:
            - rocblas_diagonal_unit:      A is assumed to be unit triangular.
            - rocblas_diagonal_non_unit:  A is not assumed to be unit triangular.

    @param[in]
    m       [rocblas_int]

    alpha
            alpha specifies the scalar alpha. When alpha is
            zero then A is not referenced and B need not be set before
            entry.

    @param[in]
    A       Device pointer to matrix A on the GPU.
            A has dimension ( lda, k ), where k is m
            when  side == rocblas_side_left  and

        Note that when  diag == rocblas_diagonal_unit  the diagonal elements of
        A  are not referenced either,  but are assumed to be  unity.

    @param[in]
    lda     [rocblas_int]
            lda specifies the first dimension of A.

                if side == rocblas_side_left,  lda >= max( 1, m ),
                if side == rocblas_side_right, lda >= max( 1, n ).

    @param[in]
    B       Device pointer to the matrix B on the GPU.

    @param[in]
    ldb    [rocblas_int]

    trsm_batched_ex solves:

        op(A_i)*X_i = alpha*B_i or X_i*op(A_i) = alpha*B_i,

    for i = 1, ..., batch_count; and where alpha is a scalar, X and B are arrays of m by n matrices,
    A is an array of triangular matrix and each op(A_i) is one of

        op( A_i ) = A_i   or   op( A_i ) = A_i^T   or   op( A_i ) = A_i^H.

    Each matrix X_i is overwritten on B_i.

    This function gives the user the ability to reuse the invA matrix between runs.
    If invA == NULL, rocblas_trsm_batched_ex will automatically calculate each invA_i on every run.

    Setting up invA:
    Each accepted invA_i matrix consists of the packed 128x128 inverses of the diagonal blocks of
    matrix A_i, followed by any smaller diagonal block that remains.
    To set up each invA_i it is recommended that rocblas_trtri_batched be used with matrix A_i as the input.
    invA is an array of pointers of batch_count length holding each invA_i.

    Device memory of size 128 x k should be allocated for each invA_i ahead of time, where k is m when
    rocblas_side_left and is n when rocblas_side_right. The actual number of elements in each invA_i
    should be passed as invA_size.

    To begin, rocblas_trtri_batched must be called on the full 128x128-sized diagonal blocks of each
    matrix A_i. Below are the restricted parameters:
      - n = 128
      - ldinvA = 128
      - stride_invA = 128x128
      - batch_count = k / 128,

    Then any remaining block may be added:
      - n = k % 128
      - invA = invA + stride_invA * previous_batch_count
      - ldinvA = 128
      - batch_count = 1

    rot_batched_ex applies the Givens rotation matrix defined by c=cos(alpha) and s=sin(alpha) to batched vectors x_i and y_i, for i = 1, ..., batch_count.
        Scalars c and s may be stored in either host or device memory. Location is specified by calling rocblas_set_pointer_mode.

    In the case where cs_type is real:

        x := c * x + s * y
        y := c * y - s * x

    In the case where cs_type is complex, the imaginary part of c is ignored:

        x := real(c) * x + s * y
        y := real(c) * y - conj(s) * x

    Currently supported datatypes are as follows:

    \\details
    symv_batched performs the matrix-vector operation:

        y_i := alpha*A_i*x_i + beta*y_i
        where (A_i, x_i, y_i) is the i-th instance of the batch.
        alpha and beta are scalars, x_i and y_i are vectors and A_i is an
        n by n symmetric matrix, for i = 1, ..., batch_count.
        A a should contain an upper or lower triangular symmetric matrix
        and the opposing triangular part of A is not referenced.

    trsv solves:

         A*x = b or
         A**T*x = b or
         A**H*x = b,
         where x and b are vectors and A is a triangular matrix.
         The vector x is overwritten on b.

    Although not widespread, some gemm kernels used by trsv may use atomic operations.
    See Atomic Operations in the API Reference Guide for more information.

    @param[in]
    handle    [rocblas_handle]
              handle to the rocblas library context queue.

    @param[in]
    uplo    [rocblas_fill]
            - rocblas_fill_upper:  A is an upper triangular matrix.
            - rocblas_fill_lower:  A is a  lower triangular matrix.

    @param[in]

            - rocblas_operation_conjugate_transpose:  op(A) = A^H

    @param[in]
    diag    [rocblas_diagonal]

            - rocblas_diagonal_non_unit:  A is not assumed to be unit triangular.

    @param[in]
    n         [rocblas_int]
              n specifies the number of rows of b. n >= 0.

    @param[in]
    A         device pointer storing matrix A, of dimension ( lda, n ). If uplo == rocblas_fill_upper, the upper triangular part of the leading n-by-n array contains the matrix A, otherwise the lower triangular part of the leading n-by-n array contains the matrix A.

    @param[in]
    lda       [rocblas_int]
              specifies the leading dimension of A. lda must be at least max( 1, n ).

    @param[in, out]
    x         device pointer storing vector x. On exit, x is overwritten with the transformed vector x.

    @param[in]
    incx      [rocblas_int]
              specifies the increment for the elements of x.

    rot_strided_batched_ex applies the Givens rotation matrix defined by c=cos(alpha) and s=sin(alpha) to strided batched vectors x_i and y_i, for i = 1, ..., batch_count.
        Scalars c and s may be stored in either host or device memory. Location is specified by calling rocblas_set_pointer_mode.

    In the case where cs_type is real:

        x := c * x + s * y
        y := c * y - s * x

    In the case where cs_type is complex, the imaginary part of c is ignored:

        x := real(c) * x + s * y
        y := real(c) * y - conj(s) * x

    Currently supported datatypes are as follows:

    |  x_type | y_type  | cs_type | execution_type |
    |---------|---------|---------|----------------|

        y_i := alpha*A_i**H*x_i + beta*y_i,
        where (A_i, x_i, y_i) is the i-th instance of the batch.
        alpha and beta are scalars, x_i and y_i are vectors and A_i is an
        m by n banded matrix with kl sub-diagonals and ku super-diagonals,
        for i = 1, ..., batch_count.

    @param[in]
    handle    [rocblas_handle]
              handle to the rocblas library context queue.
    @param[in]
    trans     [rocblas_operation]
              indicates whether matrix A is transposed (conjugated) or not.
    @param[in]
    m         [rocblas_int]
              number of rows of matrix A.

              Leading (kl + ku + 1) by n part of the matrix contains the coefficients
              of the banded matrix. The leading diagonal resides in row (ku + 1) with
              the first super-diagonal above on the RHS of row ku. The first sub-diagonal
              resides below on the LHS of row ku + 2. This propagates up and down across
              sub/super-diagonals.

    \\details
    symv_strided_batched performs the matrix-vector operation:

        y_i := alpha*A_i*x_i + beta*y_i
        where (A_i, x_i, y_i) is the i-th instance of the batch.
        alpha and beta are scalars, x_i and y_i are vectors and A_i is an
        n by n symmetric matrix, for i = 1, ..., batch_count.
        A a should contain an upper or lower triangular symmetric matrix
        and the opposing triangular part of A is not referenced.

    @param[in]
    handle    [rocblas_handle]
              handle to the rocblas library context queue
    @param[in]
    uplo      [rocblas_fill]
            specifies whether the upper 'rocblas_fill_upper' or lower 'rocblas_fill_lower'
            - if rocblas_fill_upper, the lower part of A is not referenced
            - if rocblas_fill_lower, the upper part of A is not referenced
    @param[in]
    n         [rocblas_int]
              number of rows and columns of each matrix A_i.
    @param[in]
    alpha
              device pointer or host pointer to scalar alpha.
    @param[in]
    A         Device pointer to the first matrix A_1 on the GPU.
    @param[in]
    lda       [rocblas_int]
              specifies the leading dimension of each matrix A_i.
    @param[in]
    strideA     [rocblas_stride]
                stride from the start of one matrix (A_i) and the next one (A_i+1).
    @param[in]
    x         Device pointer to the first vector x_1 on the GPU.
    @param[in]
    incx      [rocblas_int]
              specifies the increment for the elements of each vector x_i.
    @param[in]
    stridex     [rocblas_stride]
                stride from the start of one vector (x_i) and the next one (x_i+1).
                There are no restrictions placed on stride_x. However, ensure that stridex is of appropriate size.
                This typically means stridex >= n * incx. stridex should be non zero.
    @param[in]
    beta      device pointer or host pointer to scalar beta.
    @param[out]
    y         Device pointer to the first vector y_1 on the GPU.
    @param[in]
    incy      [rocblas_int]
              specifies the increment for the elements of each vector y_i.
    @param[in]
    stridey     [rocblas_stride]
                stride from the start of one vector (y_i) and the next one (y_i+1).
                There are no restrictions placed on stride_y. However, ensure that stridey is of appropriate size.
                This typically means stridey >= n * incy. stridey should be non zero.
    @param[in]
    batch_count [rocblas_int]
                number of instances in the batch.

    herkx_batched performs a batch of the matrix-matrix operations for a Hermitian rank-k update:

        C_i := alpha*op( A_i )*op( B_i )^H + beta*C_i,

        where  alpha and beta are scalars, op(A_i) and op(B_i) are n by k matrices, and
        C_i is a n x n Hermitian matrix stored as either upper or lower.

    This routine should only be used when the caller can guarantee that the result of op( A )*op( B )^T will be Hermitian.

        op( A_i ) = A_i, op( B_i ) = B_i, and A_i and B_i are n by k if trans == rocblas_operation_none
        op( A_i ) = A_i^H, op( B_i ) = B_i^H,  and A_i and B_i are k by n if trans == rocblas_operation_conjugate_transpose

    @param[in]
    handle    [rocblas_handle]
              handle to the rocblas library context queue.

    @param[in]
    n       [rocblas_int]
            n specifies the number of rows and columns of C_i. n >= 0.

    @param[in]
    k       [rocblas_int]
            k specifies the number of columns of op(A). k >= 0.

    @param[in]
    alpha
            alpha specifies the scalar alpha. When alpha is
            zero then A is not referenced and A need not be set before
            entry.

    @param[in]
    A       device array of device pointers storing each matrix_i A of dimension (lda, k)
            when trans is rocblas_operation_none, otherwise of dimension (lda, n)

    @param[in]
    lda     [rocblas_int]

            beta specifies the scalar beta. When beta is
            zero then C need not be set before entry.

    @param[in]
    C       device array of device pointers storing each matrix C_i on the GPU.
            The imaginary component of the diagonal elements are not used but are set to zero unless quick return.
            only the upper/lower triangular part of each C_i is accessed.

    @param[in]
    ldc    [rocblas_int]
           ldc specifies the first dimension of C. ldc >= max( 1, n ).

    @param[in]
    batch_count [rocblas_int]

    rotg creates the Givens rotation matrix for the vector (a b).
    Scalars a, b, c, and s may be stored in either host or device memory, location is specified by
    calling rocblas_set_pointer_mode. The computation uses the formulas

        sigma = sgn(a)    if |a| >  |b|
              = sgn(b)    if |b| >= |a|
        r = sigma*sqrt( a**2 + b**2 )
        c = 1; s = 0      if r = 0
        c = a/r; s = b/r  if r != 0

    The subroutine also computes

        z = s    if |a| > |b|,
          = 1/c  if |b| >= |a| and c != 0
          = 1    if c = 0

    This allows c and s to be reconstructed from z as follows:

        If z = 1, set c = 0, s = 1.
        If |z| < 1, set c = sqrt(1 - z**2) and s = z.
        If |z| > 1, set c = 1/z and s = sqrt( 1 - c**2).

    trsm_srided_batched performs the following strided batched operation:

        op(A_i)*X_i = alpha*B_i or
        X_i*op(A_i) = alpha*B_i, for i = 1, ..., batch_count,

        where alpha is a scalar, X and B are strided batched m by n matrices,

        A is triangular strided batched matrix and op(A) is one of

        op( A ) = A   or
        op( A ) = A^T   or
        op( A ) = A^H.

        Each matrix X_i is overwritten on B_i for i = 1, ..., batch_count.

    Note about memory allocation:
    When trsm is launched with a k evenly divisible by the internal block size of 128,
    and is no larger than 10 of these blocks, the API takes advantage of utilizing pre-allocated
    memory found in the handle to increase overall performance. This memory can be managed by using
    the environment variable WORKBUF_TRSM_B_CHNK. When this variable is not set the device memory
    used for temporary storage will default to 1 MB and may result in chunking, which in turn may
    reduce performance. Under these circumstances it is recommended that WORKBUF_TRSM_B_CHNK be set
    to the desired chunk of right hand sides to be used at a time
    (where k is m when rocblas_side_left and is n when rocblas_side_right).

    \\details
    trmm_strided_batched performs one of the matrix-matrix operations:

        C_i := alpha*op( A_i )*B_i,   or
        C_i := alpha*B_i*op( A_i )  for i = 0, 1, ... batch_count -1,

    The Legacy BLAS in-place trmm_strided_batched functionality,

        B_i := alpha*op( A_i )*B_i,   or
        B_i := alpha*B_i*op( A_i )  for i = 0, 1, ... batch_count -1,

    is available by setting pointer C equal to pointer B, ldc equal to ldb, and stride_C equal to stride_B.

        alpha  is a scalar,  B_i  is an m by n matrix, C_i  is an m by n matrix,  A_i  is a unit, or
        non-unit,  upper or lower triangular matrix  and  op( A_i )  is one  of

        op( A_i ) = A_i   or
        op( A_i ) = A_i^T   or
        op( A_i ) = A_i^H.

        When uplo == rocblas_fill_upper the  leading  k by k
        upper triangular part of the array  A must contain the upper
        triangular matrix and the strictly lower triangular part of
        A is not referenced. Here k is m when side == rocblas_side_left
        and is n when side == rocblas_side_right.

        When uplo == rocblas_fill_lower the  leading  k by k
        lower triangular part of the array  A must contain the lower
        triangular matrix  and the strictly upper triangular part of
        A is not referenced. Here k is m when  side == rocblas_side_left
        and is n when side == rocblas_side_right.

        Note that when  diag == rocblas_diagonal_unit  the diagonal elements of
        A  are not referenced either,  but are assumed to be  unity.

    @param[in]
    handle    [rocblas_handle]
              handle to the rocblas library context queue.

    @param[in]
    side    [rocblas_side]
            Specifies whether op(A_i) multiplies B_i from the left or right as follows:
            - rocblas_side_left:       C_i := alpha*op( A_i )*B_i
            - rocblas_side_right:      C_i := alpha*B_i*op( A_i )

    @param[in]
    uplo    [rocblas_fill]
            Specifies whether the matrix A is an upper or lower triangular matrix as follows:
            - rocblas_fill_upper:  A is an upper triangular matrix.
            - rocblas_fill_lower:  A is a  lower triangular matrix.

    @param[in]
    transA  [rocblas_operation]
            Specifies the form of op(A_i) to be used in the matrix multiplication as follows:
            - rocblas_operation_none:    op(A_i) = A_i
            - rocblas_operation_transpose:      op(A_i) = A_i^T
            - rocblas_operation_conjugate_transpose:  op(A_i) = A_i^H

    @param[in]
    diag    [rocblas_diagonal]
            Specifies whether or not A_i is unit triangular as follows:
            - rocblas_diagonal_unit:      A_i is assumed to be unit triangular.
            - rocblas_diagonal_non_unit:  A_i is not assumed to be unit triangular.

    @param[in]
    m       [rocblas_int]

    @param[in]
    n       [rocblas_int]
            n specifies the number of columns of B_i. n >= 0.

    @param[in]
    alpha
            alpha specifies the scalar alpha. When alpha is
            zero then A_i is not referenced and B_i need not be set before
            entry.

    @param[in]
    A       Device pointer to the first matrix A_0 on the GPU.
            Each A_i is of dimension ( lda, k ), where k is m
            when  side == rocblas_side_left  and
            is  n  when  side == rocblas_side_right.

            When uplo == rocblas_fill_upper the  leading  k by k
            upper triangular part of the array  A must contain the upper
            triangular matrix  and the strictly lower triangular part of
            A is not referenced.

            When uplo == rocblas_fill_lower the  leading  k by k
            lower triangular part of the array  A must contain the lower
            triangular matrix  and the strictly upper triangular part of
            A is not referenced.

        Note that when  diag == rocblas_diagonal_unit  the diagonal elements of
        A_i  are not referenced either,  but are assumed to be  unity.

    @param[in]
    lda     [rocblas_int]
            lda specifies the first dimension of A.

                if side == rocblas_side_left,  lda >= max( 1, m ),
                if side == rocblas_side_right, lda >= max( 1, n ).

    @param[in]
    stride_A  [rocblas_stride]
              stride from the start of one matrix (A_i) and the next one (A_i+1).

    @param[in]
    B       Device pointer to the first matrix B_0 on the GPU.

    @param[in]
    ldb    [rocblas_int]
           ldb specifies the first dimension of B_i. ldb >= max( 1, m ).

    @param[in]
    stride_B  [rocblas_stride]
              stride from the start of one matrix (B_i) and the next one (B_i+1).

    @param[out]
    C      Device pointer to the first matrix C_0 on the GPU.

    @param[in]
    ldc   [rocblas_int]
          ldc specifies the first dimension of C_i. ldc >= max( 1, m).
          If B and C pointers are to the same matrix then ldc must equal ldb or
          rocblas_status_invalid_size will be returned.

    @param[in]
    stride_C  [rocblas_stride]
              stride from the start of one matrix (C_i) and the next one (C_i+1).
              If B == C and ldb == ldc then stride_C should equal stride_B or
              behavior is undefined.

    @param[in]
    batch_count [rocblas_int]
                number of instances i in the batch.

    trsm_ex solves:

        op(A)*X = alpha*B or X*op(A) = alpha*B,

    where alpha is a scalar, X and B are m by n matrices,
    A is triangular matrix and op(A) is one of

        op( A ) = A   or   op( A ) = A^T   or   op( A ) = A^H.

    The matrix X is overwritten on B.

    This function gives the user the ability to reuse the invA matrix between runs.
    If invA == NULL, rocblas_trsm_ex will automatically calculate invA on every run.

    Setting up invA:
    The accepted invA matrix consists of the packed 128x128 inverses of the diagonal blocks of
    matrix A, followed by any smaller diagonal block that remains.
    To set up invA it is recommended that rocblas_trtri_batched be used with matrix A as the input.

    Device memory of size 128 x k should be allocated for invA ahead of time, where k is m when
    rocblas_side_left and is n when rocblas_side_right. The actual number of elements in invA
    should be passed as invA_size.

    To begin, rocblas_trtri_batched must be called on the full 128x128-sized diagonal blocks of
    matrix A. Below are the restricted parameters:
      - n = 128
      - ldinvA = 128
      - stride_invA = 128x128
      - batch_count = k / 128,

    Then any remaining block may be added:
      - n = k % 128
      - invA = invA + stride_invA * previous_batch_count
      - ldinvA = 128
      - batch_count = 1

    Although not widespread, some gemm kernels used by trsm_ex may use atomic operations.
    See Atomic Operations in the API Reference Guide for more information.

    \\brief <b> BLAS Level 3 API </b>.

    \\details
    herkx performs one of the matrix-matrix operations for a Hermitian rank-k update:

        C := alpha*op( A )*op( B )^H + beta*C,

        where  alpha and beta are scalars, op(A) and op(B) are n by k matrices, and
        C is a n x n Hermitian matrix stored as either upper or lower.

    This routine should only be used when the caller can guarantee that the result of op( A )*op( B )^T will be Hermitian.

        op( A ) = A, op( B ) = B, and A and B are n by k if trans == rocblas_operation_none
        op( A ) = A^H, op( B ) = B^H,  and A and B are k by n if trans == rocblas_operation_conjugate_transpose

    @param[in]
    handle    [rocblas_handle]
              handle to the rocblas library context queue.

    @param[in]
    uplo    [rocblas_fill]
            - rocblas_fill_upper:  C is an upper triangular matrix
            - rocblas_fill_lower:  C is a  lower triangular matrix

    @param[in]
    trans  [rocblas_operation]
            - rocblas_operation_conjugate_transpose:  op( A ) = A^H, op( B ) = B^H
            - rocblas_operation_none:                 op( A ) = A, op( B ) = B

    @param[in]
    n       [rocblas_int]
            n specifies the number of rows and columns of C. n >= 0.

    @param[in]
    k       [rocblas_int]
            k specifies the number of columns of op(A). k >= 0.

    @param[in]
    alpha
            alpha specifies the scalar alpha. When alpha is
            zero then A is not referenced and A need not be set before
            entry.

    @param[in]
    A       pointer storing matrix A on the GPU.
            Matrix dimension is ( lda, k ) when if trans = rocblas_operation_none, otherwise (lda, n)

    @param[in]
    lda     [rocblas_int]
            lda specifies the first dimension of A.

                if trans = rocblas_operation_none,  lda >= max( 1, n ),
                otherwise lda >= max( 1, k ).
    @param[in]
    B       pointer storing matrix B on the GPU.
            Matrix dimension is ( ldb, k ) when if trans = rocblas_operation_none, otherwise (ldb, n)

    @param[in]
    ldb     [rocblas_int]
            ldb specifies the first dimension of B.

                if trans = rocblas_operation_none,  ldb >= max( 1, n ),
                otherwise ldb >= max( 1, k ).

    @param[in]
    beta
            beta specifies the scalar beta. When beta is
            zero then C need not be set before entry.

    @param[in]
    C       pointer storing matrix C on the GPU.
            The imaginary component of the diagonal elements are not used but are set to zero unless quick return.
            only the upper/lower triangular part is accessed.

    @param[in]
    ldc    [rocblas_int]
           ldc specifies the first dimension of C. ldc >= max( 1, n ).

If uplo == rocblas_fill_upper, the upper triangular part of the leading n-by-n array contains the matrix A_i, otherwise the lower triangular part of the leading n-by-n array contains the matrix A_i.

    @param[in]
    lda       [rocblas_int]
              specifies the leading dimension of A_i. lda must be at least max( 1, n ).

    @param[in, out]
    x         device pointer to an array of device pointers to the x_i vectors. On exit, each x_i is overwritten with the transformed vector x_i.

    @param[in]
    incx      [rocblas_int]
              specifies the increment for the elements of vectors x_i.

    \\brief <b> BLAS Level 3 API </b>.

    \\details
    gemm performs one of the matrix-matrix operations:

        C = alpha*op( A )*op( B ) + beta*C,

        where op( X ) is one of

        op( X ) = X      or
        op( X ) = X**T   or
        op( X ) = X**H,

        alpha and beta are scalars, and A, B and C are matrices, with
        op( A ) an m by k matrix, op( B ) a k by n matrix and C an m by n matrix.

    Although not widespread, some gemm kernels may use atomic operations. See Atomic Operations
    in the API Reference Guide for more information.

        where  alpha and beta are scalars, op(A) is an n by k matrix, and
        C is a n x n Hermitian matrix stored as either upper or lower.

        op( A ) = A, and A is n by k if transA == rocblas_operation_none
        op( A ) = A^H and A is k by n if transA == rocblas_operation_conjugate_transpose

    @param[in]
    k       [rocblas_int]
            k specifies the number of columns of op(A). k >= 0.

    @param[in]
    alpha
            alpha specifies the scalar alpha. When alpha is
            zero then A is not referenced and A need not be set before
            entry.

    @param[in]
    A       pointer storing matrix A on the GPU.
            Matrix dimension is ( lda, k ) when if transA = rocblas_operation_none, otherwise (lda, n)

    @param[in]

    herkx_strided_batched performs a batch of the matrix-matrix operations for a Hermitian rank-k update:

        C_i := alpha*op( A_i )*op( B_i )^H + beta*C_i,

        where  alpha and beta are scalars, op(A_i) and op(B_i) are n by k matrices, and
        C_i is a n x n Hermitian matrix stored as either upper or lower.

    This routine should only be used when the caller can guarantee that the result of op( A )*op( B )^T will be Hermitian.

        op( A_i ) = A_i, op( B_i ) = B_i, and A_i and B_i are n by k if trans == rocblas_operation_none
        op( A_i ) = A_i^H, op( B_i ) = B_i^H,  and A_i and B_i are k by n if trans == rocblas_operation_conjugate_transpose

    @param[in]

            k specifies the number of columns of op(A). k >= 0.

    @param[in]
    alpha
            alpha specifies the scalar alpha. When alpha is
            zero then A is not referenced and A need not be set before
            entry.

    @param[in]
    A       Device pointer to the first matrix A_1 on the GPU of dimension (lda, k)
            when trans is rocblas_operation_none, otherwise of dimension (lda, n).

            zero then C need not be set before entry.

    @param[in]
    C       Device pointer to the first matrix C_1 on the GPU.
            The imaginary component of the diagonal elements are not used but are set to zero unless quick return.
            only the upper/lower triangular part of each C_i is accessed.

    @param[in]
    ldc    [rocblas_int]
           ldc specifies the first dimension of C. ldc >= max( 1, n ).

    trsm_strided_batched_ex solves:

        op(A_i)*X_i = alpha*B_i or X_i*op(A_i) = alpha*B_i,

    for i = 1, ..., batch_count; and where alpha is a scalar, X and B are strided batched m by n matrices,
    A is a strided batched triangular matrix and op(A_i) is one of

        op( A_i ) = A_i   or   op( A_i ) = A_i^T   or   op( A_i ) = A_i^H.

    Each matrix X_i is overwritten on B_i.

    This function gives the user the ability to reuse each invA_i matrix between runs.
    If invA == NULL, rocblas_trsm_batched_ex will automatically calculate each invA_i on every run.

    Setting up invA:
    Each accepted invA_i matrix consists of the packed 128x128 inverses of the diagonal blocks of
    matrix A_i, followed by any smaller diagonal block that remains.
    To set up invA_i it is recommended that rocblas_trtri_batched be used with matrix A_i as the input.
    invA is a contiguous piece of memory holding each invA_i.

    Device memory of size 128 x k should be allocated for each invA_i ahead of time, where k is m when
    rocblas_side_left and is n when rocblas_side_right. The actual number of elements in each invA_i
    should be passed as invA_size.

    To begin, rocblas_trtri_batched must be called on the full 128x128-sized diagonal blocks of each
    matrix A_i. Below are the restricted parameters:
      - n = 128
      - ldinvA = 128
      - stride_invA = 128x128
      - batch_count = k / 128

    Then any remaining block may be added:
      - n = k % 128
      - invA = invA + stride_invA * previous_batch_count
      - ldinvA = 128
      - batch_count = 1

    \\details
    syrkx performs one of the matrix-matrix operations for a symmetric rank-k update:

        C := alpha*op( A )*op( B )^T + beta*C,

        where  alpha and beta are scalars, op(A) and op(B) are n by k matrix, and
        C is a symmetric n x n matrix stored as either upper or lower.

    This routine should only be used when the caller can guarantee that the result of op( A )*op( B )^T will be symmetric.

        op( A ) = A, op( B ) = B, and A and B are n by k if trans == rocblas_operation_none
        op( A ) = A^T, op( B ) = B^T,  and A and B are k by n if trans == rocblas_operation_transpose
        or for ssyrkx and dsyrkx when trans == rocblas_operation_conjugate_transpose

              matrix dimension k.
    @param[in]
    alpha     [const void *]
              device pointer or host pointer specifying the scalar alpha. Same datatype as compute_type.

    @param[in]
    b_type    [rocblas_datatype]
              specifies the datatype of matrix B.
    @param[in]
    ldb       [rocblas_int]
              specifies the leading dimension of B.
    @param[in]
    beta      [const void *]
              device pointer or host pointer specifying the scalar beta. Same datatype as compute_type.
    @param[in]
    c         [void *]
              device pointer storing matrix C.
    @param[in]
    c_type    [rocblas_datatype]
              specifies the datatype of matrix C.
    @param[in]
    ldc       [rocblas_int]
              specifies the leading dimension of C.
    @param[out]
    d         [void *]
              device pointer storing matrix D.
              If d and c pointers are to the same matrix then d_type must equal c_type and ldd must equal ldc
              or the respective invalid status will be returned.
    @param[in]
    d_type    [rocblas_datatype]
              specifies the datatype of matrix D.
    @param[in]
    ldd       [rocblas_int]
              specifies the leading dimension of D.
    @param[in]
    compute_type
              [rocblas_datatype]
              specifies the datatype of computation.
    @param[in]
    algo      [rocblas_gemm_algo]

    @param[in]
    solution_index
              [int32_t]
              if algo is Algorithmsolution_index, this controls which solution is used.
              When algo is not Algorithmsolution_index, or if solution_index <= 0, the default solution is used.
              This parameter was unused in previous releases and instead always used the default solution
    @param[in]
    flags     [uint32_t]
              optional gemm flags.
