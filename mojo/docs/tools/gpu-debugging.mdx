The MAX SDK provides support for debugging Mojo code running on GPU using
[CUDA-GDB](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-gdb/index.html#). You can either
debug using the `cuda-gdb` command-line interface, or through VS Code, using the
Mojo and NVIDIA extensions.

:::note Limitations

Currently there are a couple of notable limitations to debugging Mojo code on
GPU:

- GPU debugging is supported only on NVIDIA GPUs.
- You cannot debug Mojo code running inside a MAX
  [custom operation](/max/custom-ops/). (You can only debug Mojo GPU code
  launched from a Mojo program when using the
  [gpu.host](/mojo/stdlib/gpu/host/) API).

:::

## GPU debugging setup

To debug Mojo code on GPU, you need to be able run Mojo code on GPU. Currently
this requires a Linux system with a supported GPU. For details, see
[GPU requirements](/max/faq/#gpu-requirements).

If you're using VS Code, you can run it on the same system where your GPU code
is running (the "target system"), or on a separate system using remote
debugging.

To debug on GPU, you need to choose to debug with CUDA-GDB when you start a
debugging session. Note that CUDA-GDB has very limited debugging capabilities
for Mojo code running on the CPU.

To set up for GPU debugging:

1. Install the [NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit)
   12.4 or later on the target system. Make sure that the `cuda-gdb`
   binary is in your `$PATH` environment variable. For example, if you have CUDA
   Toolkit 12.8 installed, add `/usr/local/cuda12.8/bin` to your `$PATH`.

2. If using VS Code, install
   [Nsight Visual Studio Code Edition](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nvidia.nsight-vscode-edition)
   from the Visual Studio Marketplace.

### Using the classic debugger backend

CUDA-GDB includes two debugger backends, called the "classic debugger" and
the "universal debugger." By default, Mojo uses the CUDA-GDB universal debugger.
However, some systems require the classic debugger, instead. If you find that the
debugger is losing its connection with the process being debugged, you may need
to use the classic debugger. To use the classic debugger backend:

- On the target system, set the environment variable
  `CUDBG_USE_LEGACY_DEBUGGER` to `1` in your shell configuration file (for
  example, `.bashrc`, `.zshrc` or `config.fish`). Source the file or start a
  new shell.

- When creating a launch configuration for GPU debugging, add the following
  settings to the `launch.json` configuration:

  ```json
  "legacyDebugger": true,
  "initCommands": [
      "set environment CUDBG_USE_LEGACY_DEBUGGER=1"
  ],
  ```

## Start GPU debugging from the command line

To start a GPU debugging session in VS Code from the command line, run the
following command on the target system:

```bash
mojo debug --cuda-gdb --break-on-launch --vscode myproject.mojo
```

To use the CUDA-GDB command line debugger, omit the `--vscode` argument.

The `--break-on-launch` flag is optional but very useful: it stops execution as
soon as the GPU kernel launches, allowing you to set breakpoints inside the GPU
code.

## Start GPU debugging from VS Code

The easiest way to start GPU debugging from VS Code is to add a
[Launch configuration](#launch-configurations). For example, the following
launch configuration starts debugging the current Mojo file using CUDA-GDB.

```json
  {
    "type": "mojo-cuda-gdb",
    "request": "launch",
    "name": "Mojo: Debug current Mojo file with CUDA-GDB",
    "description": "Launch and debug the Mojo file that is active on the editor when the debug session starts, using CUDA-GDB.",
    "mojoFile": "${file}",
    "args": [],
    "env": [],
    "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
    "breakOnLaunch": true,
    "legacyDebugger": true,
    "initCommands": [
        "set environment CUDBG_USE_LEGACY_DEBUGGER=1"
    ],
  },
```

The last two settings, `legacyDebugger` and `initCommands` should only be
included if required on your system to maintain a stable connection to the
process being debugged, as described in
[Using the classic debugger backend](#using-the-classic-debugger-backend).

## Issuing CUDA-GDB commands

Some features of the debugger are only available via CUDA-GDB commands, so it's
worth familiarizing yourself with CUDA-GDB even if you're using VS Code as a
frontend.

If you're running in VS Code, you can enter CUDA-GDB commands in the debug
console by prefixing them with a single backtick (`). Note that the console may
automatically add a second backtick at the end of your command, which prevents
it from being recognized as a CUDA-GDB command. Be sure to remove the second
backtick before submitting the command.

The examples in the following section are raw CUDA-GDB commands, without the
backtick.

A good starting point for learning about CUDA-GDB is the
[CUDA-GDB User Manual](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-gdb/index.html#)

## Tips and tricks

The following sections provide tips for some common tasks in GPU debugging.

### Setting breakpoints in GPU code

There are a few quirks to setting breakpoints in GPU code. If you set a
breakpoint in GPU code before the GPU kernel launches, the breakpoint will show
up in a different function (a CPU function).

When the debugger pauses at this first breakpoint, click **Continue** to resume
execution, and the debugger should stop at the correct location in the GPU code.
When paused at the first breakpoint, you can add more breakpoints in the GPU
code, however, the breakpoints won't show up in the left gutter until the GPU
kernel launches.

Symbol breakpoints aren't supported when debugging with CUDA-GDB.

On the CUDA-GDB command line, you can set a breakpoint using the `break`
command (which can be abbreviated to `b`):

<code><strong>break</strong> <var>filename.mojo</var>:<var>line_number</var></code><br/>
<code><strong>b</strong> <var>filename.mojo</var>:<var>line_number</var></code>

### Stepping not supported on GPU

The step commands—**Step Over**, **Step Into**, and **Step Out** do not work
reliably on GPU. Instead we recommend adding breakpoints and using **Continue**
to move between breakpoints.

### Changing kernel focus

You can use CUDA-GDB commands to change the current _kernel focus_: that is,
the block and thread index that you're currently inspecting. Use the `cuda`
to inspect the current focus or change focus:

```plaintext
cuda block thread
block (0,0,0), thread (0,0,0)
cuda block 0,0,0 thread 1,0,0
[Switching focus to CUDA kernel 0, grid 1, block (0,0,0), thread (1,0,0), device 0, sm 0, warp 0, lane 1]
```

For more information, see
[Kernel focus](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-gdb/index.html#kernel-focus) in
the CUDA-GDB documentation.

### Inspecting registers

Inspect the values of registers using the `info registers` command.

```plaintext
`info registers $R0 $R1
info registers $R0 $R1
R0             0xebfffda8          -335544920
R1             0xfffda8            16776616
```

For more information, see
[Registers](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-gdb/index.html#registers) in
the CUDA-GDB documentation.
