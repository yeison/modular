If you have an existing Python project that would benefit from Mojo's
high-performance computing, you shouldn't have to rewrite the whole thing in
Mojo. Instead, you can write just the performance-critical parts your code in
Mojo and then call it from Python.

:::caution Early preview

Calling Mojo code from Python is in early development. You should expect a lot
of changes to the API and ergonomics. Likewise, this documentation is still a
work in progress. See below for [known limitations](#known-limitations).

:::

## Import a Mojo module in Python

To illustrate what calling Mojo from Python looks like, we'll start with a
simple example, and then dig into the details of how it works and what is
possible today.

Consider a project with the following structure:

```text
project
├── 🐍 main.py
└── 🔥 mojo_module.mojo
```

The main entrypoint is a Python program called `main.py`, and the Mojo code
includes functions to call from Python.

For example, let's say we want a Mojo function to take a Python value as an
argument:

```mojo title="mojo_module.mojo"
fn factorial(py_obj: PythonObject) raises -> Python
    var n = Int(py_obj)
    return math.factorial(n)
```

And we want to call it from Python like this:

```python title="main.py"
import mojo_module

print(mojo_module.factorial(5))
```

However, before we can call the Mojo function from Python, we must declare it
so Python knows it exists.

Because Python is trying to load `mojo_module`, it looks for a function called
`PyInit_mojo_module()`. (If our file is called `foo.mojo`, the function would
be `PyInit_foo()`.) Within the `PyInit_mojo_module()`, we must declare all Mojo
functions and types that are callable from Python using
[`PythonModuleBuilder`](/mojo/stdlib/python/bindings/PythonModuleBuilder).

So the complete Mojo code looks like this:

```mojo title="mojo_module.mojo"
from python import PythonObject
from python.bindings import PythonModuleBuilder
import math
from os import abort

@export
fn PyInit_mojo_module() -> PythonObject:
    try:
        var m = PythonModuleBuilder("mojo_module")
        m.def_function[factorial]("factorial", docstring="Compute n!")
        return m.finalize()
    except e:
        return abort[PythonObject](String("error creating Python Mojo module:", e))

fn factorial(py_obj: PythonObject) raises -> PythonObject:
    # Raises an exception if `py_obj` is not convertible to a Mojo `Int`.
    var n = Int(py_obj)

    return math.factorial(n)
```

On the Python side, we currently need some more boilerplate code to make it
work (but this will improve soon):

```python title="main.py"
import max.mojo.importer
import os
import sys

sys.path.insert(0, "")

import mojo_module

print(mojo_module.factorial(5))
```

That's it! Try it:

```sh
python main.py
```

```output
120
```


### How it works

Python supports a standard mechanism called [Python extension
modules](https://docs.python.org/3/extending/extending.html) that enables
compiled languages (like Mojo, C, C++, or Rust) to make themselves callable
from Python in an intuitive way. Concretely, a Python extension module is
simply a dynamic library that defines a suitable `PyInit_*()` function.

Mojo comes with built-in functionality for defining Python extension modules.
The special stuff happens in the `max.mojo.importer` module we imported.

If we have a look at the filesystem after Python imports the Mojo code, we'll
notice there's a new `__mojocache__` directory, with dynamic library (`.so`)
file inside:

```text
project
├── main.py
├── mojo_module.mojo
└── __mojocache__
    └── mojo_module.hash-ABC123.so
```

Loading `max.mojo.importer` loads our Python Mojo [import
hook](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#import-hooks), which
behind the scenes looks for a `.mojo` (or `.🔥`) file that matches the imported
module name, and if found, compiles it using [`mojo build --emit
shared-lib`](/mojo/cli/build#--emit-file_type) to generate a static library.
The resulting file is stored in `__mojocache__`, and is rebuilt only when
it becomes stale (typically, when the Mojo source file changes).

Now that we've looked at the basics of how Mojo can be used from Python, let's
dig into the available features and how you can leverage them to accelerate
your Python with Mojo.

## Binding Mojo types

All Mojo type are eligible to be bound for use from Python.

:::note

Types currently must implement `Movable`, `Defaultable`, and `Representable`
to be bound for use from Python.

:::

This enables the type to be bound using `PythonModuleBuilder.add_type[Person]()`:

```mojo
var mb = PythonModuleBuilder("mojo_module")
mb.add_type[Person]("Person")
```

Any Mojo type bound using a `PythonTypeBuilder` will have the resulting
Python 'type' object be globally registered, enabling two features:

* Constructing Python objects that wrap Mojo values for use from Python using
  `PythonObject(alloc=Person(..))`.

* Downcasting using `python_obj.downcast_value_ptr[Person]()`

{/* <!-- TODO:
## Binding Mojo Functions
-->

<!-- TODO:
## Binding Mojo Methods
--> */}

## Constructing Python objects in Mojo

:::note

Python Mojo bindings do not currently support Mojo `__init__()` methods that
take arguments. However, a workaround is possible using free functions that
construct new objects, shown below.

:::

Mojo functions called from Python don't just need to be able to accept
[`PythonObject`](/mojo/stdlib/python/python_object/PythonObject) values as
arguments, they also need to be able to return new values. And sometimes, they
even need to be able to return Mojo native values back to Python. This is
possible by using the `PythonObject(alloc=<value>)` constructor.

An example of this looks like:

```mojo
fn create_person() -> PythonObject:
    var person = Person("Sarah", 32)
    return PythonObject(alloc=person^)
```

:::caution

`PythonObject(alloc=...)` will raise an exception if the provided Mojo
object type had not previously been registered using
[`PythonModuleBuilder.add_type()`](/mojo/stdlib/python/bindings/PythonModuleBuilder#add_type).

:::

{/*
TODO: How to distinguish this constructor from the converting constructor?
TODO: Maybe `PythonObject.mojo()` / `PythonObject(mojo_object=)`?
TODO: `PythonObject.__init__[T: AnyType](out self, *, owned alloc: T)
*/}


{/* <!--
## The `__mojocache__`

TODO: What is this directory, when is it created, what artifacts are stored in
    it, note that its always safe to delete.
--> */}

## `PythonObject` to Mojo values

Within any Mojo code that is handling a
[`PythonObject`](/mojo/stdlib/python/python_object/PythonObject), but
especially within Mojo functions called from Python, it's common to expect an
argument of a particular type. particular type and wish

There are two scenarios where a `PythonObject` can be "converted" into a native
Mojo value:

* **Converting** a Python object into a newly constructed Mojo value that has
   the same logical value as the original Python object.
   This is handled by the [`ConvertibleFromPython`][ConvertibleFromPython] trait.

* **Downcasting** a Python object that holds a native Mojo value to a pointer
   to that inner value.
   This is handled by [`PythonObject.downcast_value_ptr()`][downcast_value_ptr].

{/* <!-- TODO:
Since `PythonObject` are reference counted, and Mojo `Pointer` is guaranteed
to be either immutable or a unique pointer, safe object downcasting currently
only works to immutable pointers.
--> */}

### `PythonObject` conversions

:::note

**Binding Initializers.** One current limitation is that non-default Mojo
type `__init__()` methods cannot be bound for calling from Python. In addition
to showing argument conversions, this example also shows how a top-level
function can be used to construct and return instances of Mojo types to Python.

:::

Many Mojo types support conversion directly from equivalent Python types, via
the [`ConvertibleFromPython`][ConvertibleFromPython] trait:

```mojo
fn create_person(
    name_obj: PythonObject,
    age_obj: PythonObject
) raises -> PythonObject:
    # These conversions will raise an exception if they fail
    var name = String(name_obj)
    var age = Int(age_obj)

    return PythonObject(alloc=Person(name, age))
```

Which could be called from Python using:

```python
person = mojo_module.create_person("John Smith", 42)
```

Passing invalid arguments would result in a type error:

```python
# TODO: What is the exact error message this emits today?
person = mojo_module.create_person([1, 2, 3], {"foo": 4})
```

### `PythonObject` downcasts

Downcasting from `PythonObject` values to the inner Mojo value:

```mojo
fn print_age(person_obj: PythonObject):
    # Raises if `obj` does not contain an instance of the Mojo `Person` type.
    var person = person_obj.downcast_value_ptr[Person]()
    # TODO(MSTDL-1581):
    #   var person = Pointer[Person](downcast_value=person_obj)
    print("Person is", person[].age, "years old")
```

Unsafe mutable via downcasting is also supported. It is up to the user to ensure
that this mutable pointer does not alias any other pointers to the same object
within Mojo:

```mojo
fn birthday(person_obj: PythonObject):
    var person = person_obj.downcast_value_ptr[Person]()
    # TODO:
    #   var person = Pointer[Person](unsafe_unique_downcast=person_obj)
    person[].age += 1
```

Entirely unchecked downcasting--which does no type checking--can be done using:

```mojo
fn get_person(person_obj: PythonObject):
    var person = person_obj.unchecked_downcast_value_ptr[Person]()
    # TODO:
    #   var person = Pointer[Person](unchecked_downcast_value=person_obj)
```

Unchecked downcasting can be used to eliminate overhead when optimizing a tight
inner loop with Mojo, and you've benchmarked and measured that type checking
downcasts is a significant bottleneck.

## Writing Python in Mojo

In this approach to bindings, we embrace the flexibility of Python, and eschew
trying to convert `PythonObject` arguments into the narrowly constrained,
strongly-typed space of the Mojo type system, in favor of just writing some code
and letting it raise an exception at runtime if we got something wrong.

The flexibility of `PythonObject` enables a unique programming style, wherein
Python code can be "ported" to Mojo with relatively few changes.

```python
def foo(x, y, z):
    x[y] = int(z)
    x = y + z
```

Rule of thumb: Any Python builtin function should be accessible in Mojo using
`Python.<builtin>()`.

```mojo
fn foo(x: PythonObject, y: PythonObject, z: PythonObject) -> PythonObject:
    x[y] = Python.int(z)
    x = y + z
    x.attr = z
```

## Keyword arguments

Keyword arguments are not currently supported natively in Python Mojo bindings,
but a simple pattern can be used to provide them to users of your library, using
a Python wrapper function that passes keyword arguments into Mojo using a dict.

A simple example of this pattern looks like:

```python
import mojo_module

def supports_kwargs(pos, *, kw1 = None, kw2 = None):
    mojo_module.supports_kwargs(pos, { "kw1": kw1, "kw2": kw2})
```

```mojo
fn supports_kwargs(pos: PythonObject, kwargs: PythonObject) raises:
    var kw1 = kwargs["kw1"]
    var kw2 = kwargs["kw2"]
```

Because keyword argument validation and default values are handled within the
Python wrapper function, callers will get the standard argument errors they
expect.
And the Mojo code stays simple, as getting the keyword argument is a simple
dictionary lookup.

## Variadic functions

When binding functions using
[`PythonModuleBuilder.def_function()`](/mojo/stdlib/python/bindings/PythonModuleBuilder#def_function),
only fixed-arity functions are supported. To expose Mojo functions that accept
a variadic number of arguments to Python, you can use the lower-level
[`def_py_function()`](/mojo/stdlib/python/bindings/PythonModuleBuilder#def_py_function)
interface, which leaves it to the user to validate the number of arguments
provided.

```mojo
@export
fn PyInit_mojo_module() -> PythonObject:
    try:
        var b = PythonModuleBuilder("mojo_module")
        b.def_py_function[count_args]("count_args")
        b.def_py_function[sum_args]("sum_args")
        b.def_py_function[lookup]("lookup")

fn count_args(py_self: PythonObject, args: PythonObject) raises:
    return len(args)

fn sum_args(py_self: PythonObject, args: PythonObject) raises:
    var total = args[0]
    for i in range(1, len(args)):
        total += args[i]
    return total

fn lookup(py_self: PythonObject, args: PythonObject) raises:
    if len(args) != 2 and len(args) != 3:
        raise Error("lookup() expects 2 or 3 arguments")

    var collection = args[0]
    var key = args[1]

    try:
        return collection[key]
    except e:
        if len(args) == 3:
            return args[2]
        else:
            raise e
```

## Building Mojo extension modules

You can create and distribute your Mojo modules for Python in the following
ways:

* As source files, compiled on demand using the Python Mojo importer hook.

   The advantage of this approach is that it's easy to get started with, and
   keeps your project structure simple, while ensuring that your imported Mojo
   code is always up to date after you make an edit.

* As pre-built Python extension module `.so` dynamic libraries, compiled using:

   ```shell
   $ mojo build mojo_module.mojo --emit shared-lib -o mojo_module.so
   ```

   This has the advantage that you can specify any other necessary build options
   manually (optimization or debug flags, import paths, etc.), providing an
   "escape hatch" from the Mojo import hook abstraction for advanced users.


## Known limitations

While we have big ambitions for Python to Mojo interoperability—our goal is for
Mojo to be the best way to extend Python—this feature is still in early and
active development, and there are some limitations to be aware of. These will
be lifted over time.

* **Functions taking more than 3 arguments.**
  Currently `PyTypeBuilder.add_function()` and related
  function bindings only support Mojo functions that take up to 3 `PythonObject`
  arguments: `fn(PythonObject, PythonObject, PythonObject)`.

* **Binding non-default initializers.**
  Currently, only Mojo types that are default constructible (`Foo()`) can be
  bound and constructed using standard object init syntax from within Python.
  A workaround pattern is described below.

* **Keyword arguments.**
  Currently, Mojo functions callable from Python only natively support positional
  arguments. (However, if you really need them, a simple pattern for supporting
  keyword arguments is described below.)

* **Mojo package dependencies.**
  Mojo code that has dependencies on packages other than the Mojo stdlib
  (like those in the ever-growing
  [Modular Community](https://github.com/modular/modular-community) package
  channel) are currently only supported when building Mojo extension modules
  manually, as the Mojo import hook does not currently support a way to
  specify import paths for Mojo package dependencies.

* **Static methods.**
  Binding to type `@staticmethod` methods is not currently supported. Consider
  using a free function (top-level function) instead for the time being.

* **Properties.**
  Computed properties getter and setters are not currently supported.

* **Expected type conversions.**
  A handful of Mojo standard library types can be constructed directly from
  equivalent Python builtin object types, by implementing the
  [`ConvertibleFromPython`][ConvertibleFromPython] trait.
  However, many Mojo standard library types do not yet implement this trait,
  so may require manual conversion logic if needed.
