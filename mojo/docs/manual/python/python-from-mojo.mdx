The Python ecosystem is full of useful libraries, so you shouldn't have to
rewrite them in Mojo. Instead, you can simply import Python packages and call
Python APIs from Mojo. The Python code runs in a standard Python interpreter
(CPython), so your existing Python code doesn't need to change.

## Import a Python module in Mojo

To import a Python module in Mojo, just call
[`Python.import_module()`](/mojo/stdlib/python/python/Python#import_module)
with the module name. The following shows an example of importing the standard
Python [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) package:

```mojo
from python import Python

def main():
    # This is equivalent to Python's `import numpy as np`
    np = Python.import_module("numpy")

    # Now use numpy as if writing in Python
    array = np.array(Python.list(1, 2, 3))
    print(array)
```

Running this program produces the following output:

```
[1 2 3]
```

Assuming that you have the NumPy package installed in your
[environment](#create-a-python-environment), this imports NumPy and you can use any
of its features.

A few things to note:

* The `import_module()` method returns a reference to the module in the form of
  a [`PythonObject`](/mojo/stdlib/python/python_object/PythonObject)
  wrapper. You must store the reference in a variable and then use it as shown
  in the example above to access functions, classes, and other objects defined
  by the module. See [Mojo wrapper objects](/mojo/manual/python/types#mojo-wrapper-objects)
  for more information about the `PythonObject` type.

* Currently, you cannot import individual members (such as a single Python class
  or function). You must import the whole Python module and then access members
  through the module name.

* Mojo doesn't yet support top-level code, so the `import_module()` call must
  be inside another method. This means you may need to import a module multiple
  times or pass around a reference to the module. This works the same way as
  Python: importing the module multiple times won't run the initialization
  logic more than once, so you don't pay any performance penalty.

* `import_module()` may raise an exception (for example, if the module isn't
  installed). If you're using it inside an `fn` function, you need to either
  handle errors (using a `try/except` clause), or add the `raises` keyword to
  the function signature. You'll also see this when calling Python functions
  that may raise exceptions. (Raising exceptions is much more common in Python
  code than in the Mojo standard library, which
  [limits their use for performance reasons](/mojo/roadmap#the-standard-library-has-limited-exceptions-use).)

:::caution

[`mojo build`](/mojo/cli/build) doesn't include the Python packages used by
your Mojo project. Instead, Mojo loads the Python interpreter and Python
packages at runtime, so they must be provided in the environment where you run
the Mojo program (such as inside the Magic environment where you built the
executable). For more information, see the section above to [create a Python
environment](#create-a-python-environment).

### Import a local Python module

If you have some local Python code you want to use in Mojo, just add
the directory to the Python path and then import the module.

For example, suppose you have a Python file named `mypython.py`:

```python title="mypython.py"
import numpy as np

def gen_random_values(size, base):
    # generate a size x size array of random numbers between base and base+1
    random_array = np.random.rand(size, size)
    return random_array + base
```

Here's how you can import it and use it in a Mojo file:

```mojo title="main.mojo"
from python import Python

def main():
    Python.add_to_path("path/to/module")
    mypython = Python.import_module("mypython")

    values = mypython.gen_random_values(2, 3)
    print(values)
```

Both absolute and relative paths work with
[`add_to_path()`](/mojo/stdlib/python/python/Python#add_to_path). For example,
you can import from the local directory like this:

```mojo
Python.add_to_path(".")
```
