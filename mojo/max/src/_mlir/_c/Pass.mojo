#  Opaque type declarations.
#
#  Types are exposed to C bindings as structs containing opaque pointers. They
#  are not supposed to be inspected from C. This allows the underlying
#  representation to change without affecting the API users. The use of structs
#  instead of typedefs enables some type safety as structs are not implicitly
#  convertible to each other.
#
#  Instances of these types may or may not own the underlying object. The
#  ownership semantics is defined by how an instance of the type was obtained.
