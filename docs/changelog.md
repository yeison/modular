### ✨ Highlights

### Language changes

### Standard library changes

- A new `IntervalTree` data structure has been added to the standard library.
  This is a tree data structure that allows for efficient range queries.

- `StringSlice` now supports several additional methods moved from `String`.
  The existing `String` methods have been updated to instead call the
  corresponding new `StringSlice` methods:

  - `split()`
  - `lower()`
  - `upper()`
  - `is_ascii_digit()`
  - `isupper()`
  - `islower()`
  - `is_ascii_printable()`
  - `rjust()`
  - `ljust()`
  - `center()`
