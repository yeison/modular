# Modular Platform

> A unified platform for AI development and deployment, including **MAX**🧑‍🚀 and
**Mojo**🔥.

The Modular Platform is an open and fully-integrated suite of AI libraries
and tools that accelerates model serving and scales GenAI deployments. It
abstracts away hardware complexity so you can run the most popular open
models with industry-leading GPU and CPU performance without any code changes.

![](https://docs.modular.com/images/modular-container-stack.png?20250513)

## Get started

You don't need to clone this repo.

You can install Modular as a `pip` or `conda` package and then start an
OpenAI-compatible endpoint with a model of your choice.

If we trim the ceremonial steps, you can start a local LLM endpoint with just
two commands:

```sh
pip install modular
```

```sh
max serve --model-path=modularai/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-GGUF
```

Then start sending the Llama 3 model inference requests using [our
OpenAI-compatible REST API](https://docs.modular.com/max/api/serve).

Or try running hundreds of other models from [our model
repository](https://builds.modular.com/?category=models).

For a complete walkthrough, see [the quickstart
guide](https://docs.modular.com/max/get-started).

## Deploy our container

The MAX container is our Kubernetes-compatible Docker container for convenient
deployment, using the same inference server you get from the `max serve`
command shown above. We have separate containers for NVIDIA and AMD GPU
environments, and a unified container that works with both.

For example, you can start a container for an NVIDIA GPU with this command:

```sh
docker run --gpus=1 \
    -v ~/.cache/huggingface:/root/.cache/huggingface \
    -p 8000:8000 \
    docker.modular.com/modular/max-nvidia-full:latest \
    --model-path modularai/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-GGUF
```

For more information, see our [MAX container
docs](https://docs.modular.com/max/container) or the [Modular Docker Hub
repository](https://hub.docker.com/u/modular).

## About the repo

We're constantly open-sourcing more of the Modular Platform and you can find
all of it in here. As of May, 2025, this repo includes over 450,000 lines of
code from over 6000 contributors, providing developers with production-grade
reference implementations and tools to extend the Modular Platform with new
algorithms, operations, and hardware targets. It is quite likely **the world's
largest repository of open source CPU and GPU kernels**!

Highlights include:

- Mojo standard library: [/mojo/stdlib](mojo/stdlib)
- MAX GPU and CPU kernels: [/max/kernels](max/kernels) (Mojo kernels)
- MAX inference server: [/max/serve](max/serve) (OpenAI-compatible endpoint)
- MAX model pipelines: [/max/pipelines](max/pipelines) (Python-based graphs)
- Code example: [/examples](examples)
- Tutorials: [/tutorials](tutorials)

This repo has two major branches:

- The [`main`](https://github.com/modular/modular/tree/main) branch, which is
in sync with the nightly build and subject to new bugs. Use this branch for
[contributions](./CONTRIBUTING.md), or if you [installed the nightly
build](https://docs.modular.com/max/packages).

- The [`stable`](https://github.com/modular/modular/tree/stable) branch, which
is in sync with the last stable released version of Mojo. Use the examples in
here if you [installed the stable
build](https://docs.modular.com/max/packages).

## Contribute
