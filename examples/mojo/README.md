# Mojo code examples

A collection of sample programs written in the
[Mojo](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/) programming language.

## Getting Started

The easiest way to get started with Mojo is to install the Magic package and
virtual environment manager. By following the instructions in [Get started with
Magic](https://docs.modular.com/magic/), you can quickly install Magic and use
it to create a virtual environment for Mojo programming. Alternatively, you can
follow the instructions for how to [Add MAX/Mojo to a conda
project](https://docs.modular.com/magic/conda).

After you have set up a Mojo programming environment, you can then use `git` to
clone this repository of Mojo samples using the command below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/modular/max.git
```

## Running

If you're using [`magic`](https://docs.modular.com/magic), navigate into
the `examples` directory and use `magic run` to invoke `mojo` and run the basic
example programs. For example:

```bash
magic run mojo matmul.mojo
```

You'll also find several complete Mojo projects as subdirectories of the
`examples` directory.
